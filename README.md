## Background

I was tired to copy the URL of pages to paste it in [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) website 100 times per hours while I was reading scientific papers. 

So I've created a very simple button addon for [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) which do it all for me.

## Installing

This part will explain you how to load the plugin in developper mode. I would recommand you to prefer installing the plugin from the official stores (with links above).

### Firefox

<!-- https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/23/loading-temporary-add-ons/ -->

Open the debug page on the addon section

```
about:debugging#addons
``` 

> Depending on your version of Firefox, this link may redirect you somewhere else. e.g. Ff 71 => `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`

From that webpage, press the bug button **Load Temporary Addon-On...** and choose the _manifest.json_.

### Chrome/Chromium

IDK

## How to use

Go on scientific page with PDF hidden behind a paywall, click on the _Auto Sci-Hub_ button, and Sci-Hub will pop up with your PDF on another tab ðŸ˜€

## Acknowledgments

PS: If the plugin is not available on markets anymore, it must be due to the fact that it doesn't respect Market Policy, so build it from source (it's a very simple plugin based on JS API, so it should work on any browser version) and enjoy the plugin ! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

<!-- I hate you my friends, I had to do it... 

PS: I'm not using Chrome nor Chromium, and I'm too lazy to take a look on development for that software... So consider switching to Firefox ðŸ¦Š

PPS: If you're not as lazy as I am, feel free to send it to me in a pull request ^^
